Hello I like to drink cold soda and explode with anger on how poorly other people program
It is really annoying, but what can I do? people are just bad programmers
So therefore, I should do everything the opposite of how it is done.
No hiring lazy programmers who pretend bugs don't exist
and pearson is stupid.
